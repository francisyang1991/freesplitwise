# Bug Fixes and Improvements - January 15, 2025

## Overview

This document details the critical bug fixes and improvements made to the SplitNinja expense management system, focusing on payer selection functionality, auto-distribution logic, and user experience enhancements.

## Critical Bug Fixes

### 1. Payer Selection Modal Issues

**Problem**: The "who paid" modal had several critical issues:
- Paid total didn't match total amount when changing payers
- Checkboxes couldn't be deselected properly
- Multiple payers weren't displayed correctly after saving
- Original payer couldn't be deselected

**Root Causes**:
- `distributeAutoPaid` function had rounding errors causing negative amounts
- `togglePayerSelection` logic was inverted (`autoPaid: !selected`)
- State synchronization issues between modal and form
- `payerSummaryForForm` used raw `rows` instead of normalized data

**Solutions Implemented**:

#### Fixed Auto-Distribution Logic
```typescript
// Before: Could cause negative amounts
amount = Math.round((normalizedWeight / totalWeight) * distributable);

// After: Prevents negative amounts
if (index === autoEntries.length - 1) {
  amount = Math.max(0, distributable - distributed);
}
```

#### Corrected Payer Selection Logic
```typescript
// Before: Inverted logic
autoPaid: !selected

// After: Correct logic
autoPaid: !selected // If selected=true, autoPaid=false (manual payer)
```

#### Fixed State Synchronization
```typescript
// Before: Used raw rows state
const payerSummaryForForm = formatPayerSummaryFromRows(rows, memberLookup, sessionMemberId);

// After: Used normalized data with auto-distributed amounts
const payerSummaryForForm = formatPayerSummaryFromRows(normalizedRowsForDisplay, memberLookup, sessionMemberId);
```

### 2. Paid Total Calculation Bug

**Problem**: When changing who paid in the expense form, the paid total would double instead of updating correctly.

**Root Cause**: The `selectPayer` function wasn't properly clearing other payers' amounts when selecting a new payer.

**Solution**: Refactored to use direct state updates with `setRows` instead of `updateRowsWithDistribution`:

```typescript
const selectPayer = (membershipId: string) => {
  defaultPayerAppliedRef.current = true;
  setRows((prevRows) => {
    return prevRows.map((row) => {
      if (row.membershipId === membershipId) {
        return {
          ...row,
          paid: formattedTotal,
          autoPaid: false, // Manual payer
        };
      } else {
        return {
          ...row,
          paid: "", // Clear other payers
          autoPaid: true, // Auto-distributed
        };
      }
    });
  });
};
```

### 3. Checkbox Functionality Issues

**Problem**: Users couldn't freely select and deselect payers in the modal.

**Root Cause**: Complex fallback logic prevented deselection and caused inconsistent behavior.

**Solution**: Simplified the `togglePayerSelection` function to focus only on selection status:

```typescript
const togglePayerSelection = (membershipId: string, selected: boolean) => {
  defaultPayerAppliedRef.current = true;
  setRows((prevRows) => {
    const updatedRows = prevRows.map((row) => {
      if (row.membershipId !== membershipId) return row;
      return {
        ...row,
        autoPaid: !selected, // If selected=true, autoPaid=false (manual payer)
        paid: "", // Clear paid amount, will be recalculated
      };
    });
    return distributeAutoPaid(updatedRows, totalAmountCents);
  });
};
```

### 3. Enhanced Settlement Actions

**Feature**: Improved settlement action button with better UI and permissions.

**Implementation**:
- Created `SettlementActionButton` component
- Added permission checks for marking payments as paid
- Improved mobile positioning and styling
- Added share functionality for settlements

**Benefits**:
- Better mobile experience
- Clearer permission handling
- Enhanced sharing capabilities

## Testing Improvements

### Comprehensive Component Tests

Added extensive test coverage for the expense form component:

```typescript
describe('Payer selection', () => {
  it('allows selecting multiple payers via checkboxes', async () => {
    // Test multi-payer selection
  });

  it('ensures at least one payer remains selected', async () => {
    // Test fallback behavior
  });

  it('allows selecting and deselecting individual payers freely', async () => {
    // Test free selection/deselection
  });
});
```

### Test Statistics
- **Total test suites**: 6 (up from 5)
- **Total tests**: 65+ (up from 53)
- **Component tests**: Added comprehensive React Testing Library tests
